OS JOBS (Operating System) 

-Runs and manages software and hardware 

-Allows all components to run correctly and fluidly together 

-Coordinates each program to allocate a specified amount of research 

DIFFERENT TYPES OF OS 

WINDOWS 

-By Microsoft 

-Proprietary (only modifiable by company who owns it) 

-Can serve as remote desktops 

-Most common OS on computers 

LINUX (lih-nucks) 

-Open source (opposite of proprietary) 

-Entirely free 

-Many different distributions available 

AWS OS OPTIONS 

-EC2 based virtual machines 

-“Linux 2” 

AWS COMPUTE SERVICES 

-Virtual Machines 

-Containers 

-Serverless 

-Platforms as Services 

VIRTUAL MACHINE CATEGORIES 

-EC2 

-Serverless (AWS Lambda) 

-Containers (Elastic Container Service, Kubernetes Service, Fargate, Container Register) 

WHAT IS A VM (Virtual Machine) 

-Software based computer existing within another computer’s OS 

HYPERVISOR 

-Piece of software/firmware/hardware that VMs require to run off of 

-Acts as a “host machine” 

 

 

2 OR MORE OPERATING SYSTEMS? 

-Yes 

-Can sound like an oxymoron 

-Users can run VMs and OS can be run at the same time 

HOW DOES CLOUD COMPUTING USE VIRTUAL MACHINES? 

-Running SaaS (Software as a Service) 

-Backing up data 

-Hosting services like email and access management 

WHAT IS EC2 

-Elastic Compute Cloud 

-Used more as a SaaS 

AMI (AMAZON MACHINE IMAGES) 

-One or more EBS Snapshots for instance-store-backed AMIs, a template for the root volume of the instance 

-Launch permissions that control that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances 

-AMIs including QuickStart AMI 

-My AMI 

-AWS Marketplace AMI 

-Community AMI 

-AWS Per-Second Billing 

-On-Demand 

-All regions available 

-Amazon Linux or Ubuntu 

-Pillar 1. Right Size 

-Pillar 2. Increasing elasticity 

-Pillar 3. Leverage the right pricing model 

-Pillar 4. Optimize storage 

(MEASURE MONITOR AND IMPROVE) 

WHAT ARE CONTAINERS? 

-Used through operating system virtualizations 

-Advantageous in consistency and Application Version Control 

 

 

 

DOCKERS 

-Containers that are standard units of software that packages all codes up and its dependencies 

KUBERNETES 

-Portable extensible and open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services 

-Kubernetes enables deployment and management of containerized applications 

DOCKERS v KUBERNETES 

-Dockers allow more isolated environment, easy modeling and application agility 

-Kubernetes offer automated scheduling, higher resource utilization within higher densities 

SERVERLESS COMPUTING 

-Serverless computing is a method of providing backend services 

-High Benefits of cost of Serverless 

LAMBDA 

-BYOC (Bring your own code) 

-Completely automated administration 

-Build-in Fault Tolerance 

-Orchestrates multiple functions 

-Only pay for what is used 

WHAT IS PLATFORM AS A SERVICE? (PaaS) 

-Platforms as a service, for example, Elastic Beanstalk 

(What I learned in this topic was that Virtual Machines are a much higher efficiency form of computing than I once thought) 

 

(The summary of all the topics in this section is to demonstrate how efficient Virtual Machines within EC2 and other AWS’s, allowing developmental structures of coding.)
